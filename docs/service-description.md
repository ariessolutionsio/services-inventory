This project is a microservice designed for managing inventory in high-throughput environments. Unlike traditional warehouse inventory systems that include complex logistics and inventory balancing features, this service focuses on maintaining a streamlined dataset to track availability across different inventory locations (referred to as Nodes within the industry). The primary aim is to support online experiences, where rapid and numerous API calls are expected. The inventory availability is dynamically updated to reflect online sales and stock refreshes from physical stores as they happen.
