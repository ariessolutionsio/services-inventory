**Update Inventory for Node and Remove All Reservations**

This API method is designed to update the inventory level for a specific inventory location (Node) and simultaneously remove all existing reservations associated with that Node. This operation is crucial for scenarios where inventory data needs to be refreshed or corrected, ensuring that the inventory levels accurately reflect the current stock without the constraints of prior reservations.
